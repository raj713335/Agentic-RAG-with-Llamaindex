Task instances are validated through execution-based validation and continuously updated to reflect new language models and code repositories. The dataset includes task instances from various repositories like astropy, django, flask, matplotlib, pylint, pytest, requests, scikit-learn, seaborn, sphinx, sympy, and xarray.\n",
      "assistant: The evaluation dataset used in MetaGPT includes HumanEval, MBPP, and the SoftwareDev dataset. It consists of tasks related to software development, such as creating games, processing data, managing CRUD operations, transcribing music, generating press releases, and developing interactive dashboards. The dataset covers a variety of tasks that require programming skills and encompass different aspects of software development.\n",

      "The LongLoRA paper introduces an efficient fine-tuning approach for extending the context sizes of pre-trained large language models (LLMs) with limited computation cost. It utilizes shifted sparse attention (S2-Attn) during training to approximate long contexts efficiently, while retaining the original attention architecture for inference. This method allows for extending the context window of LLMs while reducing computational costs compared to full fine-tuning approaches. In contrast, traditional low-rank adaptation (LoRA) for context extension is found to be less effective and efficient in comparison. LongLoRA combines S2-Attn with LoRA, demonstrating strong empirical results on various tasks and achieving significant context extensions on LLMs like Llama2 models. The approach emphasizes the importance of learnable embedding and normalization layers for successful long context fine-tuning, showcasing effectiveness and efficiency in extending context lengths while maintaining performance and reducing computational expenses.\n",

      "The approach in the LoftQ paper introduces a novel quantization framework that focuses on simultaneously quantizing a Large Language Model (LLM) and finding a suitable low-rank initialization for LoRA fine-tuning. This method actively integrates low-rank approximation with quantization to align with the original pre-trained weights, providing a better initialization point for subsequent LoRA fine-tuning and improving generalization in downstream tasks. In contrast, traditional quantization methods like QLoRA primarily concentrate on quantization techniques and may overlook the importance of subsequent LoRA fine-tuning. LoftQ's approach of jointly optimizing the initial values of the quantized backbone and low-rank adapters through an alternating optimization process sets it apart from conventional quantization methods. LoftQ's method of minimizing the discrepancy introduced by quantization during LoRA fine-tuning and its effectiveness in low-bit scenarios distinguish it from existing quantization approaches like QLoRA. Additionally, LoftQ demonstrates compatibility with different quantization functions, achieves efficient compression ratios, and outperforms baseline methods like QLoRA in various scenarios, showcasing its effectiveness in preserving the starting point of pre-trained weights and improving overall performance.\n",
